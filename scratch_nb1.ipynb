    "            Guidelines:\n",

    "            - When joining tables ensure all join columns are the same data_type.\n",

    "            - Don't include any comments in code.\n",
    "            - **Remove ```sql and ``` from the output and generate the SQL in single line.**\n",
    "            - Tables should be refered to using a fully qualified name with enclosed in ticks (`) e.g. `project_id.owner.table_name`.\n",
    "            - Use all the non-aggregated columns from the \"SELECT\" statement while framing \"GROUP BY\" block.\n",
    "            - Use ONLY the column names (column_name) mentioned in Table Schema. DO NOT USE any other column names outside of this.\n",
    "            - Associate column_name mentioned in Table Schema only to the table_name specified under Table Schema.\n",
    "            - Table names are case sensitive. DO NOT uppercase or lowercase the table names.\n",
    "            - Always enclose subqueries and union queries in brackets.\n",
    "            - Refer to the examples provided below, if given.\n",
    "            - If the question is not clear, answer with : {\"Sorry. No information available for this question.\"}\n",

    "            - When question is about average feature contribution to churn, use customer_shap_contributions columns only in the output unless it's necessary\n",
    "            - ***When a subset data query is asked DONOT use LIMIT. Return query for whole data asked for***\n",
    "            - When using a column make sure it's available in the table schema provided.\n",

      "1. **Price Optimization for Young Customers:**  Analyze revenue per minute pricing for young customers (20-25) and those around 35. Offer more competitive pricing plans or bundles tailored to their needs and preferences. Consider tiered plans based on age or specific usage patterns. \n",
      "2. **Equipment Upgrade Campaigns for Younger Customers:**  Run targeted campaigns to encourage younger customers to upgrade their equipment, addressing their desire for newer technology and features. Offer attractive trade-in incentives or flexible payment plans.\n",
      "3. **Special Offers for New Customers Under 40:** Implement programs that target new customers under 40 with specific discounts or benefits to encourage loyalty.  \n",
      "4. **Promote \"Value-Added\" Services:**  Introduce new services or promotions that cater to the needs and interests of young customers, such as streaming services, gaming bundles, or social media perks.\n",
      "5. **Enhanced Customer Engagement:**  Increase engagement with young customers through social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, and interactive experiences that cater to their preferred communication styles and digital platforms.\n",

Reducing it to 0.2 could lead to a significant decrease in churn probability. \\n* **Increase average call duration:** This customer's average call duration is currently 0.0. Increase it to 5.5 to potentially decrease churn.\\n* **Adjust handset price and quantity:** Reduce the handset price from 100.0 to 45.7 and decrease the number of handsets from 2 to 1.2 to decrease churn probability.\\n\\n\\nThese recommendations are based on the customer counterfactual analysis.

The current value is 0.0, increasing to 0.2 could reduce churn probability. \\n* **Increase Dropped/Blocked Calls:**  Increase the number of dropped/blocked calls from the current 0.0 to 1.6 to potentially decrease churn probability.\\n* **Reduce Current Equipment Days:** Reduce the number of days the customer has been using their current equipment from 949.0 to 206.4 to possibly decrease churn.\\n* **Reduce Revenue Per Minute:** Reduce the revenue per minute from 5.0 to 0.3 to potentially decrease churn probability.\\n* **Increase Average Call Duration:**  Increase average call duration from 0.0 to 8.1 to potentially lower churn probability.\\n* **Increase Active Subscriptions:** Increase the number of active subscriptions from the current 3 to 4, which could lower the churn probability.\\n* **Decrease Handset Models:** Reduce the number of handset models from the current 3.0 to 1.2 to potentially decrease churn.\\n\\nThese recommendations are based on the customer counterfactual analysis. Implementing these changes can potentially lower the churn probability for this customer.  \\n\\n\\n\\n'}\n",
